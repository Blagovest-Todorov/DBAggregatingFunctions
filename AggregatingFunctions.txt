Data aggregating Functions are used for dataAnalysis,
Performa analysis on data,
MIN, MAX,AVG,COUNT, operate on nonEMpty groups

An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.
 Except for COUNT(*), aggregate functions ignore null values.
 Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) 
to group the result-set by one or more columns.

WE can use aggregating ffns without GRUP BY , and then all records in the tab le will be taken as one group 
over whisch calculations will be made ! 

 SELECT    
	AVG(Salary) AS EmpoyeeNumber
  FROM Employees
//calculates avg salary base on all rows-records ! 
constraint -is control mechanism in Relationa DD, in no RElationa DB no constraints, 
RDB slower than NoRDB
-- HAVING is the same as WHERE -> for filtering data based on aggregation, 
WHERE filters before aggregation, HAVIng filters after AGGREGATION

  SELECT TotalSalary 

///

SELECT Count(*) AS [Count]
FROM WizzardDeposits

SELECT MAX(MagicWandSize) AS LongestMagicWand
FROM WizzardDeposits

SELECT TOP(1) MagicWandSize AS LongestMagicWand
FROM WizzardDeposits
ORDER BY MagicWandSize DESC

SELECT 
    DepositGroup,
    MAX(MagicWandSize) AS LongestMagicWand
FROM 
    WizzardDeposits
GROUP BY 
     DepositGroup


	 SELECT 
	       TOP(2) DepositGroup
		   --,AVG(MagicWandSize) 
	 FROM WizzardDeposits
	 GROUP BY DepositGroup
	 ORDER BY AVG(MagicWandSize)
  FROM 
	  (SELECT 
	      DepartmentID
		  ,SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
	  FROM 
	      Employees
	  WHERE 
	      DepartmentID In (1, 3, 15)
	  GROUP BY 
		  DepartmentID) AS dt	
  WHERE 
	  dt.TotalSalary > 300000

WE can change HAVING with two selects nested selects 

  SELECT 
	      DepartmentID
		  ,SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
	  FROM 
	      Employees
	  WHERE 
	      DepartmentID In (1, 3, 15)
	  GROUP BY 
		  DepartmentID 
	  HAVING SUM(Salary) > 300000

PIVOT TABLE aggregates data from another table, applies aggr. operaton 
PIVOT = rotating
rows to make it like columns, 
unpivot make the opposite of pivot take the colums to rows
